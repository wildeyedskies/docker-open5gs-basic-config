# Docker open5gs basic config

This is a config for open5gs based on [docker_open5gs](https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs) but stripped down to just include everything needed for a single machine LTE deployment.

This _should_ work by editing the .env file and then running `docker-compose up`
